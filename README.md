# CUDA Programming

## Accelerating Applications with CUDA C/C++

## Objectives
 By the time you complete this lab, you will be able to: 

* Write, compile, and run C/C++ programs that both call CPU functions and launch GPU kernels.

* Control parallel thread hierarchy using execution configuration.

* Refactor serial loops to execute their iterations in parallel on a GPU.

* Allocate and free memory available to both CPUs and GPUs.

* Handle errors generated by CUDA code.

* Accelerate CPU-only applications.
